# Assembly 8086: String Manipulation, Stack Operations, and Numeric Analysis

This project demonstrates a variety of operations using Assembly 8086, including string manipulation, stack operations, and numeric analysis. The program reads numeric input from the user, calculates the sum of its digits, counts the number of digits, and performs additional operations using strings and the stack.

## Features

- **Numeric Input Handling**: Reads a numeric input from the user (up to 6 digits).
- **Digit Sum Calculation**: Calculates the sum of the digits of the input number.
- **Digit Count**: Counts the number of digits in the input number.
- **String Manipulation**: Performs operations on strings, including concatenation and conversion.
- **Stack Operations**: Demonstrates the use of stack operations for storing and retrieving data.

## Usage

1. Compile the assembly code using an assembler (e.g., NASM, MASM).
2. Run the compiled program in an appropriate emulator or on compatible hardware.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input a number and view the results.

## Code Overview

The main parts of the code include:

1. **Input Handling**: Reads the user's input and stores it in memory.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Iterates through the digits of the input to calculate the sum.
3. **Digit Counting**: Counts the number of digits in the input.
4. **String Operations**: Performs various string manipulations.
5. **Stack Usage**: Utilizes stack operations for temporary data storage.

## Example

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a number. The program will then display the sum of the digits and the number of digits, along with performing additional string and stack operations.
